                    <p>President C. Shane Reese has announced in a recent interview after the recent commitments of athletes to BYU the lowering of the ROC Pass price. The news, breaking just days after Egor Demin declared for the NBA Draft, has sparked a wave of excitement and relief among BYU students.</p>

                    <p>Mary Hawkes, a Supply Chain Management student at BYU, couldn't hide her enthusiasm when she heard the announcement. "Thank the heavens! It was just too expensive for a seat that wasnâ€™t even guaranteed," she said. Tyler Carley, a pre-med student, added with a smile, "Buckets. Simply buckets." It's clear that for many students, this decision has come as a much-needed breath of fresh air.</p>

                    <p>When asked about the specific details of the price reduction, President Reese acknowledged the ongoing discussions, saying, "We're currently assessing the factors involved, but we expect the cost to decrease by at least $50." While the exact amount is still being finalized, it's a step in the right direction for students at BYU.</p>
